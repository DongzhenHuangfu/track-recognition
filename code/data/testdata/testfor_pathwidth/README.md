data1: the old cones which will be added new cones
data2: new cones with great radius(left=25,right=28) and right order
data3: same cones as data2 but not right order
data4: same cones as data2, but add some cones with make the radius in some place smaller, but only onece a time(which means all the cones will be added).
data5: same cones as data2, but add some cones with make the radius in some place smaller, more than one continuously(which means NOT all the cones will be added).
